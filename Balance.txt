Good morning everyone.
I am Subhajit Sahu, and i have worked on the design and implementation of heterogeneous sensor-based embedded system for flood management
as my final year project, under the guidance of professor D. P. Acharya.

The objective of this work was to design and implement a modern internet-based flood management system, that is simple, cost effective, easy to deploy and use.

In the next few minutes i shall be describing about the hardware and software architecture of the system, data-flow and results and finally a pcb that was designed.

We have used an ATmega328 8-bit microcontroller for the sensor module that accepts analog signals from the sensors, processes it and accordingly controls a GSM GPRS module
for wireless data transmission.

This is the implemetation of of the sensor module. 

Ok, we have a ...

motivation
The monitoring  flood efficieny flood management depends on the online monitoring of different parametersa like water level ()at different sites in the river, humidity temperature, and rain fall.
if such a system 
indegineously developed
